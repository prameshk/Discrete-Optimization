# Discrete Optimization

This is a github repository for codes related to discrete optimization algorithms. This includes the following:
- Subgradient Method (Uncapacitated Facility Location)
- Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition solved using Column generation (Cutting stock problem and Shortest path with resource constraints problem)
- Benders Decomposition (Uncapacitated Facility Location)
- Knapsack Cover Inequalities Cutting Plane Algorithm
